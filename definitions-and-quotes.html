            " [D]oing disability bioethics well involves careful consideration of where one turns for data, how one interprets and otherwise reflectively analyzes that data, who is at the table-and brought to it-with respect to deciision-making at basic, clinical, and translational levels, and the values upon which one's research more generally is anchored."

        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Disability Justice:</strong> A framework that examines disability and ableism as it relates to other forms of oppression and identity, centering intersectionality and collective liberation.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Epistemic Injustice:</strong> Harm done to someone in their capacity as a knower, often through prejudice or lack of credibility given to their knowledge or experience.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Testimonial Injustice:</strong> A type of epistemic injustice where someone’s word is given less credibility due to prejudice about their social identity (e.g., race, gender, disability).
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Hermeneutical Injustice:</strong> A type of epistemic injustice that occurs when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage in making sense of their social experiences.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Ableism:</strong> “A system that places value on people’s bodies and minds based on societally constructed ideas of normalcy, intelligence, excellence and productivity. These constructed ideas are deeply rooted in anti-Blackness, eugenics, colonialism and capitalism. This form of systemic oppression leads to people and society determining who is valuable and worthy based on a person’s appearance and/or their ability to satisfactorily [re]produce, excel and ‘behave.’ You do not have to be disabled to experience ableism.”

        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Medical Model of Disability:</strong> A perspective that views disability primarily as a problem of the individual, caused by physical or mental impairments, to be treated or cured by medical intervention.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Social Model of Disability:</strong> A perspective that locates disability in the barriers, attitudes, and exclusion created by society, rather than in the individual’s impairment.
        </div>
        <div class="definition">
            <strong>Moral Model of Disability:</strong> A perspective that interprets disability as a result of moral failing, sin, or as a test or punishment, often leading to stigma or exclusion.
