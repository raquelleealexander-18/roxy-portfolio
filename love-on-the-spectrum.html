        <article>
            <p>I lived in a shared house with five other roommates for a year and a half. During the last six months I lived there, a Canadian man studying law moved into one of the upstairs rooms. Most nights he sat in the shared living room, sunken into the beaten-up leather couch... watching what he claimed to be his favorite show: <em>Love on the Spectrum</em>.</p>

            <p>As an Autistic queer woman, I found this display of allyship (if you could call it that) confusing. Of course, I was happy that the series was ‘trying’ to break down social ideologies around disabled people, love, and sex. Yet something about watching an NT ooh-and-aww over autistic people ‘finding love’ didn’t sit right with me.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Unlike literature’s representation of disabled people as ‘exotic aliens’ and ‘uncomplicated figures’... I find that this Netflix series operates as circuses and zoos have always done; displaying disabled peoples as spectacles to observe."
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is the chameleon nature of ableism at work (Schalk 2022, 146). As TL Lewis says, “there is no ableism without racism” (quoted by Schalk 2022, 145). Since its original release date on May 18th 2022, there have been 22 episodes featuring 14 main or recurring cast members, of which only one has been Black.</p>

            <p>Journey Early is a queer Black woman who made her debut on Season 2 of the series. This choice made by producers and casting feels performative, a gesture not of good will but one of tokenization.</p>
